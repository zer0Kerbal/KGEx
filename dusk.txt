arr
This mod simply adds an advanced radiothermal generator- powerful enough to power a dawn engine on it's own. To make up for the immense power increase to the basic RTG, the Dusk weighs over eleven times as much- though it still only weighs 0.9 tons. On top of the energy production, the Dusk also stores a small amount of electricity and xenon gas.
