![Super 100 Shooting Star](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/thumbnails/32/576/310/172/kugu0oq.jpg)
 * 3.75m Command pod capable of accommodating a crew of six.
 * This contains a 3.75m Command pod with IVA, a modified 3.75m heat shield with custom texture and fairing.
 * The command pod has 8 retrorockets that can be used as LES and propulsive-landing.
 * IVA requires Raster Prop Monitor to work.
