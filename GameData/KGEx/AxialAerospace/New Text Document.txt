New From Axial Aerospace...  A couple of parts to solve a hole in the stock lineup!  

 

There are great cargo bays in several other big mod packs, but a request came up for just a couple of simple cargo bays.... and here they are!  I even stopped myself from scope creeping this until there were two dozen different parts!  Bays come in 1.25m and 2.5m diameters.  They've got enough heat tolerance to survive a well planned reentry.  Included is a slim version of the Junior docking port designed to fit on the mid-bay-wall node of the bays without sticking through the outside of the bay.
