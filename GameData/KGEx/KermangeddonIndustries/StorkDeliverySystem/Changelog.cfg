    -----0.21----

        fixed slight mesh glitch in medium legs

    -----0.2------

        moved up center of mass for legs to avoid situation when they reverted to horizontal position even from horizontal one
        slightly raised mass of every part to balance them against stock truss and landing legs mass (also joints are a little stornger now but you still need minimal amount of struts)
        fixed mesh problems
        added decoupler function to stork legs (in the middle point where you normally mount cargo) so you don't need to add additional separator/decoupler to them
        changed stork decoupler to two-side separator to enable clean separation (might be important if you reuse other parts of rocket)

    ------0.1------

    Initial release:

        3 parts (short, medium frame with legs and bottom decoupler)
