Warnings or 'cabin sticky notes'
- When placing engines above center of mass be sure to either lock gimbals or not use SAS because of KSP bug {you might try to solve it using Tweakable Everything mod and reversing thrust of engines that are above center of mass}
- Avoid rocket/jet blast directed at the legs when they are extended. Prolonged blast wil destroy the frame.
- Extending process take some time so you have to account for that when preparing to land.

Suggested mods

Mobile Frame System - Stork legs are designed primarily to ease delivering of vehicles to the planetary surface.
