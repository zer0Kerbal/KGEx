Hello everyone!

This is my first mod created for KSP, and the first mod for a PC game I've done in nearly four years. It's been a while!

I wanted to release a few parts I've created for the MK1 sized lander can. I tried to make them as stock-alike as possible.

If you download these parts, please give me feedback! I would love to hear what anyone thinks of them.

Parts -

MK1 Lander Fuel Tank

A big fuel tank styled after the Apollo LEM's descent stage. There's a recess in the bottom to allow the engine to be mostly covered. The mission flag is also toggle-able.

Dust Plume Deflector

One of the things that I thought gives the LEM it's recognizable silhouette were these little pieces. They are found under the Aerodynamics tab and they add nothing to the craft except looks. I like them!

Radially-Attachable Fuel Tank

Contains as much fuel as a Round-8 tank but styled after an Oscar-B, this fuel tank was designed to hang on the MK1 lander can to help make it look more "Apollo." Could also be useful for probes or rovers, I would imagine.

UPDATE (1/5/2015)

I've also made a version of the fuel tank for the MK2 sized lander can (Rockomax sized.)

I also added a line to the .CFG file for the Oscar-B Radial tank for FuelCrossfeed - on my game it wasn't working correctly (although the previous version *did* work when I initially tested it)
