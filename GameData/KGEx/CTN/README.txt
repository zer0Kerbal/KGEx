Hi!

Thanks for downloading my Phoenix Industries ³Sat mod!

This mod is based on the real-life CubeSat standard. It utilizes
MechJeb, but can be enjoyed without it installed.

Some notes:

There are two sizes - tiny and small. Each size contains its own battery supply,
SAS level, and antenna.

The inside of the chassis for each ³Sat can be stacked (like stacking reaction
wheels and fuel) or surface-attached (like attaching batteries or instruments
inside.)

Any other questions, comments, or concerns - please post on the official forum
thread:
