description = Space for two kerbals, but don't try and drive from the rear cockpit, you only see helmet.  Launch it vertically, drive it horizontally, crash it any way you like.  The pod includes a small RTG and battery pack. There is not enough power to keep the cart moving at top speed for long, slower speeds are advised for continued best efficiency.  Or just add more power.
