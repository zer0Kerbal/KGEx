		change = integrated SSPXr patch for end cap switching
		change = [NEW][BUG 1.0.0.3a] Warning on PartSubtype WhiteHandles on module ModuleB9PartSwitch (moduleID='endcapSwitch') on part unknownPart: No transforms named '25mCapWhite' found

		change = [NEW][BUG 1.0.0.3a] Warning on PartSubtype BlackHandles on module ModuleB9PartSwitch (moduleID='endcapSwitch2') on part unknownPart: No transforms named '25mCapBlackFlip' found
		change = [D][BUG 1.0.0.3a] B9 Warning: timing, its all about the timing
		change = made the SSPXr patch run AFTER the ReStock which runs AFTER MoreHitchhikers
		change = lots of math to adjust position comment: what took so long was the SSPX textures didn't quite fit and took custom placement complicated by the ReStock adjustments. All good now.
		change = several missing negative signs (-) in scale made the endcaps appear see-through because they were upside down or something like that.
