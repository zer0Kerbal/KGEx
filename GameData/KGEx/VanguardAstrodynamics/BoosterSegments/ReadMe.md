## BoosterSegments (KBS)
### Adds one stockalike (1) part to Kerbal Space Program

Kickback Booster Segments

Nothing overly special, just take a chainsaw to a Kickback, and presto! The motor plus three SF blocks should provide near-identical performance to a Kickback. There is a slight height variance as the kickback segments are actually different lengths and I just chopped the first one off. They are TweakScale compatible, but mind the amount of fuel it adds. The standard motor (and each block) contains 650 SolidFuel. TweakScale it up to 200% and it contains 5200 SolidFuel. Randazzo had to finagle the Solidfuel flow so you may be able to find ways to abuse these.

### Parts:
 + none
 + adds docking port size / gender(if gendered) / and if shielded to description in editor for all docking ports.
 + adds vfx and sfx to docking ports that are missing them (stock sfx vfx)
 + Supports Near Future Construction docking port sizes

#### Installation Directions (assumes basic KSP mod installation knowledge):
- Extract to your KSP folder.
