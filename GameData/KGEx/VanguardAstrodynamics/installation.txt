Installation
-----------
VX Series II

Drag the contents of the GameData folder from the zip file into your local Kerbal Space Program/GameData folder. 
If properly installed, the tree would be as follows:
	
	Kerbal Space Program
	     - GameData
		 - VanguardAstrodynamics

------------
Legacy Parts (Impulse and Big Impulse)

Complete the instructions above. Once the main pack is installed, drag the contents of the Legacy folder from the zip file into your
local Kerbal Space Program/GameData folder. The directory tree should be unchanged.

It is important to note that these legacy parts have had their configuration files modified from the originals to be compatible with the Series II pack. Any saves
using the original Impulse or Big Impulse engines will still have them replaced by the Pegasus or Sleipnir engines respectively.
