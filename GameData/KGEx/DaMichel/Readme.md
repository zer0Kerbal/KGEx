### ***Radial Aerodynamic RTG***
* because DaMichael could.
* ~~~Has much lower drag in FAR than stock RTG due to not having attach nodes (might not be true any longer)~~~

* ***[NEW]*** Radial Aero Fuel Cell - with ODFC support

### 2.5m Cargo Bays
* 2.5m diameter
* 1m, 2m and 4m lengths
* The doors are designed to require less room for opening than a standard design made of a single door piece
* Fits well to KWRocketry and B9 parts
* *relatively* stock-like. 

The CargoBay need the Firespitter DLL, which is not included at the moment. Get it from the Firespitter mod.

For the lack of a better name. These parts are rectangular fuselage pieces meant to be radially attached. You get two center pieces, an air inlet, a terminal piece, an adapter to the standard 1.25 m parts and as extras a smallish tail boom and a slanted cone.

Notes

* This is a revision of the 2014 release. Now with better looking (i think) textures and mesh.

* ***RealFuels compatibiliy:*** configs are included.

* ***AJE compatiblity:*** The inlet has a configuration for AJE. I copied the config for the Sp+ rectangular inlet and made the inlet area larger. Not sure what i'm doing though.

* ***Swappable Tanks:*** If you have the Firespitter DLL and no RealFuels it will use it to give the parts swappable tanks. So you can chose between LF, LF+OX and MP variants.

* ***Usage of FerramAerospaceResearch*** is strongly recommended. The parts have some values for stock aerodynamic parameters but i have no idea if they are reasonable nor will i take the time to balance for stock. In contrast, FAR figures this stuff out automagically.

* ***ActiveTextureManager:*** I include a configuration which scaling in general and compression of the normal map. If you like a more aggressive configuration you should probably delete the cfg (damichel-fuselage-ATM.cfg).

* Relies on ***ModuleManager*** for the extra configurations, which is however not included. I haven't checked what happens if it is not already installed ...

Old Stuff Below

Edit: Update Mar, 06 2014. Current content:







The Intake needs the KineTechAnimation DLL. It was included previously but since i don't want to keep track of it i removed it. Get it from the B9 mod or Taverio's Pizza and Aerospace.

Here is the download link

The textures on the fuselage are deliberately a bit lowres. If you like it more highres, i can give you the original texture in twice the resolution next update.
