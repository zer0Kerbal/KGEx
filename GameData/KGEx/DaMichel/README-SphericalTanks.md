Stats

This is a modernization of DaMichel's DMTanks pack of Spherical Tanks developed in KSP 0.25. The tank configurations have been brought up to KSP 1.0.5+ balance standards, and allow fuel switching with Firespitter, Real Fuels, and Modular Fuel Tanks (not included). These tanks can give some interesting aesthetics to your fuel stations and interplanetary ships and bases, and are great for a different look.
