 Alpha 0.4 Kerbal Stuff

I will add a few beauty shots of A0.4 as I take them, lol..

Updated to KSP 1.0.5
- Fixed an issue with the bottom attachment node
- Split the heat shield off to be a separate object to solve the issue with stock reentry heating
(performance is slightly better than the stock Mk 1-2 pod and heat shield)
- Added a texture and normal map for the outer shell of the pod
- Added textures for both the exterior and interior windows
- Remodeled most of the airlock - added handles for kerbals on EVA
- Added handle bars to the interior
- Included a remodeled instrument panel
- Rearranged gauges for the new panel and for future props (still a WIP)
- Various other tweaks that I probably forgot
