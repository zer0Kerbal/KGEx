# JD Liquid Fuel Cell
## version v.1.0.0.1

Tired of having to lug around oxidizer to generate electrical charge for your full electric props or wheels? JDSA has ya covered! With the fuel cell needed nothing more than liquid fuel and having it's own built in intake vent and storage batteries, gone are the days where you have to include oxidizer, extra batteries and extra space.
